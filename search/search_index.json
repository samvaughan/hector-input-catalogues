To begin with, we've sub-divided the large WAVES North and South regions of sky into five smaller regions of roughly 60 square degrees: G12, G15, G23, H01 and H03. As the survey progresses, we'll add more of these.</p> <p>Along with the clusters, this makes 15 unique regions which this pipeline will create catalogues for. The ultimate outputs of this pipeline are the catalogues of galaxy targets, guide stars and standard stars for each of these regions.</p> <p>The list of Hector regions and the sky coordinates of their centres (in degrees) is below, and can also be downloaded as a .csv file here</p> Region Name Right Ascension Declination A0151 17.10920 -15.40920 A3158 55.77040 -53.65310 A3266 67.77460 -61.44360 A3376 90.15290 -40.03260 A3391 96.58590 -53.69330 A3395 96.88000 -54.43740 A3667 303.09170 -56.81520 A3716 312.86000 -52.70700 A2399 329.372605 -7.796920 A0119 14.067150 -1.255370 A0085 10.460211 -9.303184 G12 180 0.0 G15 225 0.0 G23 345 -32.5 H01 15 30 H03 45 30 <ol> <li> <p>Really more like 10- the clusters A3391 and A3395 are merging, and are treated as a single field in the pipeline.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"adding_a_new_region/","title":"Adding a new Region","text":""},{"location":"walkthrough/","title":"Running the Code","text":"<p>To run the code re-make the catalogues for all of the Hector regions, all you need to run is:</p> <pre><code>snakemake --cores 1 results/RegionCatalogues/{WAVES_N/WAVES_S}/{region_name}/{region_name}_Hector_target_galaxies.csv}\n</code></pre> <p>from this folder. <code>{region_name}</code> refers to G12, G15, etc, or a new region entirely (see Adding a New Region). Unlike for some of the other pipelines I've written for Hector, there isn't a config file you need to point to. The required input files you'll need for this to work and the steps that the pipeline will carry out are outlined below.</p> <p>Important note: the default choice of sub-sampling method during the target selection is randomly selecting galaxies above a given stellar mass. I've tried very hard to ensure that I'm using a set random seed, such that if you ran this pipeline twice you'd get identical catalogues out. I can't guarantee that this will always be the case if you make changes to the code, however! Please make a back up of the master catalogues for each region before running this code again. I'd highly recommend that you only use this code to make catalogues for new regions, and that the catalogues for the clusters, G12, G15, G23, H01 and H03 remain fixed. Otherwise, galaxies which we've already observed might not be included in the re-made catalogues, and this would make a horrible mess going forward!</p>"},{"location":"walkthrough/#necessary-input-catalogues","title":"Necessary input catalogues","text":"<p>To run this code, you'll need some master input catalogues. These have been created by other people and kindly contributed to the Hector survey. They;re not public, and so aren't stored on the github repo.

These contain the catalogues of galaxy targets for the Clusters, WAVES North and WAVES South. </p> <p>The cluster input catalogue was made by Matt Owers- talk to him if you have any questions! The WAVES catalogues were created by Sabine Bellstedt from the master WAVES catalogues, with some basic cuts to remove stars. </p> <p>You will also need the file <code>resources/Previous_Redshift_Cats/hemispec.v0.91recommended.parquet</code>. This is a compendium of literature redshifts put together by Ned Taylor for the 4HS survey. Ask him if you have any questions!</p> <p>To de-select SAMI galaxies, I'm using Jesse van de Sande's table of kinematic measurements. But really any SAMI catalogue would do here. </p> <p>Finally, you'll need a catalogue of standard stars (also known as \"F stars\" due to their spectral type) for the clusters. Matt Owers has made these, and you should have the files <code>DeCaLs_DR9_Fstars.fits</code>, <code>DeCaLs_DR9_Guide_Stars.fits</code>, <code>HECTOR_CRS_fstars_RUN8_DR9.txt</code> and <code>HECTOR_CRS_guides_RUN8_DR9.txt</code> in the <code>resources/ClusterStarCatalogues/</code> folder.
