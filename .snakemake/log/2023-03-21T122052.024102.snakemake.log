Job 2: Preparing the WAVES catalogue
Reason: Missing output files: results/FinalInputCatalogues/WAVES_N_redshifts_final_input.parquet, results/FinalInputCatalogues/WAVES_S_redshifts_final_input.parquet

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule prepare_WAVES_catalogue in line 91 of /Users/samvaughan/Science/Hector/Targets/MakeInputCatalogues/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/FinalInputCatalogues/WAVES_S_redshifts_final_input.parquet completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 2
Removing output files of failed job prepare_WAVES_catalogue since they might be corrupted:
results/FinalInputCatalogues/WAVES_N_redshifts_final_input.parquet
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
